The `Agoraplex` platform is a collection of tools for building
applications in Python based on a healthy mix of idiomatic Python and
sexy paradigms, including:

    - :wikipedia:`Representational State Transfer`

      Yes, we :wikipedia:`HATEOAS`, too.

    - :wikipedia:`Functional programming`

      ...especially :wikipedia:`Function composition (computer science)`

    - `Small pieces, loosely joined <http://www.smallpieces.com/>`__.

      ...both in Weinberger's original sense, and in the sense that we
      try to maximize cohesion within the platform's parts, and make
      each part maximally useful on its own.

    - `Strong opinions
      <http://www.saffo.com/02008/07/26/strong-opinions-weakly-held/>`__,
      `weakly held
      <http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/07/strong_opinions.html>`__

      The platform is opinionated, inasmuch as the *path of least
      resistance* reflects our opinions and best practices, as refined
      over time. However, the platform also does its best *not* to
      stand in the way of your forming your own opinions, and revising
      them as you "prove yourself wrong."
